              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Elderly Neighbour Watch was founded in 2023 with a simple but
                powerful vision: no elderly person should face daily challenges
                alone when caring neighbors are just around the corner.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our founder, inspired by her own grandmother's struggles with
                isolation and daily tasks, recognized that many communities have
                both elderly residents who need support and caring individuals
                who want to helpâ€”but no easy way to connect them.
              </p>

              <p>
                What started as informal neighborhood helping has grown into a
                structured network that ensures reliable, ongoing support while
                building meaningful relationships between generations.
              </p>

                  <p>
                    Seniors, family members, or care providers can request help
                    through our secure platform. We collect essential
                    information while respecting privacy and ensuring consent.

                  <h3>Careful Matching</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our coordinators match requests with volunteers based on
                    location, availability, skills, and personal compatibility
                    to ensure the best possible partnerships.

                    and events that strengthen neighborhood connections and
                    combat social isolation.
